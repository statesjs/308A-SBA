Name: Cocktail Companion

Idea:

As a bartender:

- Are you a bartender that get's asked to make cocktails that no one has ever heard of? Do they expect you to know 500+ recipes? Maybe even remember what their great-great-great-grandfather made up in the 1700's? Well this is my solution. An all in one place for searching and finding that cocktail instanly, no going through google and getting hit with a bazillion different sources, simple enough to get the job done, but simple enough to streamline getting it done during those bar rush hours.

As a bar go-er:

- Tired of ordering the same old drinks? A margartia. Mojito. Moscow mules. Let's try something new! Here is an all in one place you can find what cocktail you can ask the bartender with what available options it takes to make it so he can quickly peek over and give you a yes or no on if it's possible. Better yet, if you can see what ingredients they have available, you can answer that yourself!
