Name: Cocktail Companion

Problem to Solve:

For my fellow bartenders:

- Are you a bartender that get's asked to make cocktails that no one has ever heard of? Do they expect you to know 500+ recipes? Maybe even remember what their great-great-great-grandfather made up in the 1700's? Well this is my solution. An all in one place for searching and finding that cocktail instanly, no going through google and getting hit with a bazillion different sources, simple enough to get the job done, but simple enough to streamline getting it done during those bar rush hours.

For my fellow bar go-ers:

- Tired of ordering the same old drinks? A margartia. Mojito. Moscow mules. Let's try something new! Here is an all in one place you can find what cocktail you can ask the bartender with what available options it takes to make it so he can quickly peek over and give you a yes or no on if it's possible. Better yet, if you can see what ingredients they have available, you can answer that yourself!

| ✅     | Use the fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API. Use the data provided by this API to populate your application’s content and features.                                         | 20%    |
| ✅     | Create user interaction with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data.                                    | 15%    |
| ✅     | Enable user manipulation of data within the API through the use of POST, PUT, or PATCH requests. Ensure your chosen API supports this feature before beginning.                                    | 15%    |

| ✅     | Ensure the program runs as expected, without any undesired behavior caused by misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls being handled out of order, etc.). | 5%     |
| ✅     | Create an engaging user experience through the use of HTML and CSS.                                                                                                                                | 5%     |
| ✅     | Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).                                               | 10%    |
| ✅     | Commit frequently to the git repository.                                                                                                                                                           | 5%     |
